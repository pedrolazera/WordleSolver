# WordleSolver
**WordleSolver** is a julia package to solve Wordle games.

## How it works

A Wordle game is a triplet (G, H, limit), where...

* **G** is the set of all possible guesses (words)
* **H** (a subset of G) is the set all possible hiddenwords
* **limit** is the maximum number of guesses alowed
